# All The Beans - CoffeeBeanAPI

# Technologies 
- VISUAL STUDIO 2022
- .NET CORE 8. The latest supported version of .NET CORE
- SQL SERVER - A common relational database. I've used it extensively and had an instance ready to use. 
- ENTITY FRAMEWORK - Reliable library to handle ORM and database interaction.   

# Considerations
I started with a data first approach, based on the JSON data. Some JSON fields were modified when inserted into SQL server.
Modifications are detailed below.

- Changed id keep convention:
"_id" --> "id" 

- Changed cost from string to decimal, limited to 2 decimal points. For future use in calculations.
"Â£17.69" --> 17.69


- No status field present. In this project the API delete removes it from the database. Possible enhancement is adding a status field, so that deleting a product would mark it as inactive instead of deleting the data.
 

# Implementation Notes
3.	Implement business logic to ensure:
Each day, a new "Bean of the Day" is selected randomly from the available beans.
The selected bean cannot be the same as the previous day.

- Added a BEANOFTHEDAY table to keep the history. This does make the isBOTD field redundant, so it is set to false for all records.  
- The stored procedure [SP_BEANOFTHEDAY] will work for any day, past or future for maximum flexiblity. The assumption is that whatever application is calling the API beanoftheday would be passing the current date. 



4.	Implement a database search feature to show products available
- If no match found for the search term, it returns no products.
- Can search by the following coffee bean properties: name, colour,description, country
- It currently search by one field at a time. In future, it would be modified into a combined search. 


# Instructions
- Create a SQL Server 2019+ instance 
- Run the SLQSETUP.sql file as admin to create the database and insert the data. 

- Change the connection string in appsettings.json to match.<br>
  _"CoffeeProductContext": "data source={SQLSERVER};initial catalog=AllTheBeans;user Id=COFFEE_USER;Password=VWQKh9WP3Ctogh5KNhe9;TrustServerCertificate=True"_
  
- Run the project from visual studio and try the API!
